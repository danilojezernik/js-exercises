# Exercise for-loop with break and continue

### Exercise 1: Sum of Odd Numbers
Write a program that calculates the sum of all odd numbers between 1 and 20, but stops adding if the sum exceeds 50. Use a for loop and a break statement.

### Exercise 2: Skipping Multiples of 3
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 20, but skips multiples of 3. Use a for loop and a continue statement.

### Exercise 3: Finding the First Prime Number
Write a program that finds and prints the first prime number greater than 50. Use a while loop, and use a break statement when the first prime number is found.

### Exercise 4: Divisible by Both 2 and 5
Write a program that prints the first 5 numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by both 2 and 5. Use a for loop and a continue statement to skip numbers that are not divisible by both.

### Exercise 5: Sum of Even Numbers in an Array
Write a program that iterates through an array of integers and calculates the sum of the even numbers. Use a for loop and a continue statement to skip the odd numbers.
