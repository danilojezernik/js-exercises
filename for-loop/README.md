# JavaScript Exercises FOR LOOP

## Explain

Computers when programmed correctly, can repeatedly do many jobs with perfection. This is one of the major advantage why
we like to deal with the computers. In case of high calculation intensive data or large amount of data processing
activities, human resources are not reliable in terms of accuracy and productivity as compared to computers.

Nothing is automatic unless someone does it. Yes, we human beings can automate a process by developing and executing
programs in a computer. The feature of repetitiveness in a programming makes tedious data processing work amazingly
efficient and accurate as compared to doing it manually.

One of the repetitive control feature in a programming is known as `for statement` of `for-loop` is for our rescue for
any data intensive processing work. Let's try to explore how `for-loop` works. Suppose our program contains only
a `for-loop`, then in a very generic `for-loop` can be expressed as follows:

```javascript
for (start - loop; loop - condition; counter - update) {
    execute
    statement(s)
}
```

- `start-loop` is a simple way of initialization of a variable and anyway from some point the process of repetitive
  cycle has to be get started
