# JavaScript Exercises

This is for learning purposes only. The questions are based on the official JavaScript documentation, and other sources. The answers are not guaranteed to be correct. It is something I'm doing as a personal project to learn and understand JavaScript better. It is still under development, and I will probably be adding more questions and answers as I learn more about JavaScript or combine or delete current ones.
